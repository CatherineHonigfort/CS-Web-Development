<h3> Hamilton, the newest broadway musical, is sweeping the nation, and with good reason. </h3>

<article>
<p> "Hamilton" tells the life and times of America's founding father who is featured on the $10 bill. Notable achievements of Alexander Hamilton include: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Founder of the National Treasury </li>
	<li> Founder of the New York Times Newspaper </li>
	<li> Decorated soldier who was instrumental in the Revolutionary War </li>
	<li> Active Member of the original Congress and Cabinet </li>
	<li> Author of 51 of the Federalist Papers </li>
</ul>
<p> This musical starts in the British West Indies where Alexander Hamilton was born, and follows his life as he travels, against all odds, to New York to attend King's College. In New York is where he meets other men and women who will be remembered in the history books, such as Aaron Burr, French fighter Marie-Joseph Paul Lafayette, his future wife Eliza Schuyler, General George Washington, and many others. Through the multitude of well crafted songs, the audience learns about the revolutionary war, George Washington's presidency, John Adam's presidency, and finally up to the first weeks of Thomas Jefferson's presidency. </p>

<h3> You may be asking yourself, "Who would even think to use music to describe America's least remembered founding father?" </h3>

He spent 6 years drafting this musical. After an excessive amount of research, his play has hit the big stage, and he has won three Tony awards for his efforts: Best Book of a Musical, Best Musical, and Best Original Score. Over all, Hamilton has been nominated for 16 different Tonys and has won 11 of them. If, at this point, you're wondering "where can I listen to these songs without paying $849 for the cheapest possible seat on broadway?"or "If every single showing of Hamilton at The Fox has already been sold out, two years in advance, how will I ever get to listen to the music?". Well, we're all in luck, because Lin Miranda has given permission to release all of the songs on YouTube. If you're interested, here are a couple of my favorites:</p>
<h4>**** NOTE!: Some of this music does contain a bad word or two, please don't play these songs on speakers with small children in the room! *** </h4>
<h4>** Second Note: The listener should also be aware that Alexander Hamilton is in fact 5'7" of concentrated sass, so prepare to have your image of the founding fathers being boring old men completely obliterated, they were actually incredibly brilliant arguing 5 year olds.</h4>

<p> I hope you like the songs if you check them out. If you don't like Hamilton, please let me know, because I may have future homeworks about the musical, because I'm full of ridiculously useless facts about both the musical and the founding father, but I definitely won't make you read about it/him if you hate it </p>

<p> I hope this isn't too cheesy. Hamilton is amazing, though, and if you haven't gotten a chance to listen to the music you should check it out!<br>
